Create a temporary folder C:\mywork.  

Save my java files DecisionTreeAlgorithm, Attribute, AttributeDO, AttributeValue , DecisionNode, Instance, InstanceIndexer Instances, Node, Utility and MLException in it.

Run Command Prompt and Type
C:\> cd \mywork
This makes C:\mywork the current directory.

C:\mywork> dir
This displays the directory contents.  You should see my files among the files.

C:\mywork> set path=%path%;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_79\bin
(use the JDK folder for the version installed on your system).  This tells the system where to find JDK programs.

C:\mywork> javac DecisionTreeAlgorithm.java
This runs javac.exe, the compiler.  You should see nothing but the next system prompt...

C:\mywork> dir
javac has created the .class  files for all the files above.  You should see these among the files.

(I am including my .class files made with the above mentioned jdk version.)

C:\mywork>java DecisionTreeAlgorithm 4 5 "C:/Users/Dharmam/git/machine-learning/ml.playground/src/main/resources/data_sets_1/training_set.csv" "C:/Users/Dharmam/git/machine-learning/ml.playground/src/main/resources/data_sets_1/validation_set.csv" "C:/Users/Dharmam/git/machine-learning/ml.playground/src/main/resources/data_sets_1/test_set.csv" "yes" "yes"

this will execute the programm.

You will See the tree.

Parameters : - 

a) L value
 - Number of times you want to run "pruning" algorithm.
b) K value
 - Number of nodes to be "pruned".
c) <training-set> location (./data_sets1/training_set.csv)
 
d) <validation-set> location (./data_sets1/validation_set.csv)
 
e) <test-set> location (./data_sets1/test_set.csv)
 
f) <to-print> (yes | no)


g) <isRandom> (yes | no) -- THIS IS FOR THE BONUS PART.
